# FinFET Circuit Design and Characterization

## Introduction

<details>
<summary> What is FinFET?</summary>
<br>
FINFET stands for Fin Field Effect Transistor it belongs to the FET family and it is a type of Multi gate MOSFET that is used in place of a common MOSFET.
  
#### Key Features of FinFET Technology
* `3D Structure:` The vertical fin design improves control over the channel, allowing for higher performance at smaller nodes.
* `Improved Electrostatic Control:` By surrounding the channel with the gate on three sides, FinFETs reduce leakage currents and improve switching speeds.
* `Scalability:` FinFET technology enables continued scaling of transistors beyond the limitations faced by planar designs.

<summary> Why FinFETs?</summary>
<br>
  
* To follow Mooreâ€™s, we have to increase the number of transistors which leads to downscaling of the transistor dimensions and results in several SCEs. 
* FinFET is one of the favorable devices due to more controllability of the gate over the channel 
* Chenming Hu, and his group in 1998 were the first who coined the term FinFET, as a result of the structure.
