<summary> What is FinFET?</summary>
<br>
FINFET stands for Fin Field Effect Transistor it belongs to the FET family and it is a type of Multi gate MOSFET that is used in place of a common MOSFET.
  
#### Key Features of FinFET Technology
* `3D Structure:` The vertical fin design improves control over the channel, allowing for higher performance at smaller nodes.
* `Improved Electrostatic Control:` By surrounding the channel with the gate on three sides, FinFETs reduce leakage currents and improve switching speeds.
* `Scalability:` FinFET technology enables continued scaling of transistors beyond the limitations faced by planar designs.
